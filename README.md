I'm a first year CS student at the **University of Ottawa**. My pronouns are *she/her*. </br>
As a fairly new coder, I am working on improving my skills and experimenting with new projects. </br>
**Python** is my main programming language as of now. I also have familiarity with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. </br>
I am currently interested in learning Java, MySQL, React, and Node.
